# API keys

## What is an API Key?

* An API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. The program or application then calls the API or application programming interface to identify its user, developer or calling program to a website.

## When and Why to Use API Keys
 
* Authentication tokens are used to identify the users, i.e., the person who is using that particular website or application.
* API keys are used to identifying the project making the call. This can either be the website or the application that is making the call to the application programming interface.
